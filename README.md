# newspage

This is, as it is, 
my pet project to learn **React**. 
It is but an *attempt* to make a news website. 

Backend is built on **Python** and stored here: 
https://github.com/rustychaze/newspage/blob/main/backend.py

Frontend is done by using **JavaScript** and is stored here:
https://github.com/rustychaze/newspage/tree/main/ui/src

On **Backend** I used: 
- `Python`; 
- `Flask`;
- `psycopg2` library for PostgreSQL.

On **Frontend** I used: 
- `react`;
- `react-bootstrap`; 
- `react-router-dom`.
